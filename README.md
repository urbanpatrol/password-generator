## Description

The project is to create an app that runs in your browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript. The app should have a clean and polished interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screens sizes.

## Links
You can find the Password Generator for reference here [Password Generator](https://urbanpatrol.github.io/password-generator/index.html)

## Approach
We were supplied with starter code HTML, CSS and JS with various references as to what was required in terms of code.

I reverse engineered this app starting with the end display but hours and hours of research. Mostly I searched Google for "password generator in javascript" as a reference and although a number of resources popped up, it was a case of picking at each and building a block of functional code.

I noticed on a number of resources that a copy feature was added for ease which I will consider adding as an addition to this project when time allows - makes life easier :)

## Challenges
There was no one single reference with the answer online and it took ages to build up a block of functional snippets. What was difficult was that there was no way, at least for me, to test various snippets without the full feature. Everything was tested via the console checking errors with trial and error.

Overall, I felt this was a huge leap from class activity.
